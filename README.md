drunkzackkitz
=============

The engine that runs the twitter bot [@drunkzackkitz](http://twitter.com/drunkzackkitz)

## Installation

Install requirements in a `virtualenv`. 

## Configuration

drunkzackkitz currently requires four environment variables to be set, they are all related to twitter authentication

* `OAUTH_TOKEN`
* `OAUTH_SECRET`
* `CONSUMER_KEY`
* `CONSUMER_SECRET`

The corpus is currently just a text file of my past tweets. This should be changed in a upcoming release. If you'd like to change it, just change the contents of `zack.txt`

## Running

`$ /path/to/virtualenv/bin/python run.py`

## Testing

Uhh.. Nope

## Contributing

Uhh. Sure

## License

Which ever is the most flexible one. MIT, maybe? Someone PR this.
